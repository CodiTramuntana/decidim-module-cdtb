    Installs a GitHub workflow to validate that all migrations from all engines have been installed

    Available workflows:
    - linters: Analizes app artifacts with Rubocop.
    - ci_app: Runs Rspec specs for the Rails app.
    - validate_migrations: Validates that the app has the migrations from all gems already installed.
    - zeitwerk: Cheks that all artifacts accomplish with Zeitwerk's loading rules.

Example:
    rails generate cdtb:github_actions:github_actions validate_migrations

    This will create:
