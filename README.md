## Usage

### Organizations information

Returns information regarding the organizations in a multitenant installation that match a search term ignorecase.


The following will return all the attributes for all organizations that contain the "vila" term in its host name:

```
bin/rake cdtb:org_by_host_like[vila,true]
```

With the `full` argument set to `true` will return the most relevant attributes:

```
bin/rake cdtb:org_by_host_like[vila]
>>> Organization [1] Sant Boi de Llobregat:
host: localhost, time_zone: Madrid, locales: ca + [ca, es, oc], available authorizations: [postal_letter, members_picker_authorization_handler]
```

### Fix nicknames

In a previous version than Decidim v0.25 a validation to the `Decidim::User.nickname` was added with a migration to fix existing nicknames. But the migration was only taking into acocunt managed (impersonated) users.

This task iterates (with `find_each`) over all non managed users and nicknamizes the nickname.

To execute the task run:

```
bin/rake cdtb:fix_nicknames
```

1. Download the assets to a temporary directory:
    `aws s3 sync s3://bucket-name tmp/storage/`
2. Move the downloaded assets into the local storage directory doing the sharding:
    `bin/rake cdtb:s3_to_local:do_sharding`
3. Update all blobs to use the local service
    `bin/rake cdtb:s3_to_local:set_local_service_on_blobs`
4. Clean the cache:
    `bin/rake cache:clear`
5. Restart the Rails server

### Detect spam

To detect spam in Decidim.

#### Detect spam users
Detects users susceptible of being spammers. It can run on all organizations or be scoped to a single organization by passing the organization ID as the rake task parameter.

This rake task export a .csv with a list of all the searched users. A column indicates if each user is suspicious of being a spammer or not.
The columns in the CSV are: "ID, "Is suspicious?", "Name", "Email", "Nickname", "Personal URL", "About"

Examples:
`bin/rake cdtb:spam:users[org_id]` --> find users in organization with an id.
`bin/rake cdtb:spam:users` --> find all users in all organizations.

To set custom words in the rake, you can override it with an initalizer:

Decidim::Cdtb::Spam::UserSpamDetector.configure do |config|
  config.spam_words = %w[word1 word2]
end

#### Validate migrations
